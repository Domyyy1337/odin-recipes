    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Need a fluffy pancake recipe? This one is just right, especially when

      cream!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine milk and vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to
        make sour milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
        mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into soured milk. Pour flour mixture
        into milk mixture and whisk until lumps are gone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat it with cooking spray.
        Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles form
        and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and
        cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
